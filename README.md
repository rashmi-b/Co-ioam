# Co-ioam

Providing reliable and continuous wireless connectivity for large-scale IoT deployments
is a challenge for network operators. Conventional methods of acquiring network telemetry data 
such as ping, snmp, coap, are costly in terms of additional bandwidth consumption, 
battery depletion, increased network congestion, leading to degraded application QoS. 
We propose an in-situ network telemetry transport mechanism, 
termed Co-iOAM (Telemetry in-situ Operations Administration and Maintenance), 
for monitoring and troubleshooting resource constrained 6LoWPAN/LPWAN networks, 
where telemetry data is appended as metadata accompanying application packet at intermediate nodes. 

Further, Co-iOAM can be used for performance analysis of the path traversed by the 
application packets, network lifetime estimation, and network planning.
